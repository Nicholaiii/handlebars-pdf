# handlebars-pdf
Render PDF from handlebars. Writes to a file and returns a promise.

## Example usage:
```js
'use strict'

let PDF = require('handlebars-pdf')
let document = {
        template: '<h1>{{msg}}</h1>'+
        '<p style="color:red">Red text</p>'+
        '<img src="https://archive.org/services/img/image" />',
        context: {
            msg: 'Hello world'
        },
        path: "./test-"+Math.random()+".pdf"
    }

PDF.create(document)
    .then(res => {
        console.log(res)
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error)
    })

```

## Future
Support for headers and footers, also returning buffers/streams instead of writing a file.

## Contributing
I will review any PR sent, so please go ahead and submit one, if you feel like it!

## Alternatives
[handlebars-to-pdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars-to-pdf) Takes callbacks and returns buffers.

This module is inspired by handlebars-to-pdf, but fixes what I recognise as some shortcomings.
